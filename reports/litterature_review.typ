= Paragraph 1 - Polarisation affective et lien avec polarisation idéologique 

== Introduction
Avant de commencer cette revue de littérature, il convient d'affirmer que les liens entre polarisation politique et polarisation Idéologiques ne sont pas évident. On peut citer dans un premier temps "Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization"@iyengar2012affect comme l'un des premiers articles qui tend à distinguer polarisation idéologique et politique. Nous allons explorer les différentes perspectives théoriques et les preuves empiriques concernant la relation entre l'animosité partisane (dimension affective) et les divergences sur les positions politiques (dimension idéologique).
On notera également que les articles les plus catégoriques entre l'existence ou non d'un lien entre polarisation politique et idéologique se portent principalement sur le sytème américain, tandis que les articles sur les sytèmes européens semblent plus nuancées

== Le paradigme de l'identité sociale : la polarisation affective comme phénomène autonome de l'idéologie ?

L'approche dominante initiée par Iyengar, Sood et Lelkes (2012) soutient que la polarisation affective est principalement fondée sur l'identité sociale plutôt que sur les positions idéologiques.@iyengar2012affect. Qu'est ce que l'idée d'identité sociale ? 
Pour citer Autin : "La théorie de l’identité sociale s’ inscrit dans la perspective de l’étude des conflits intergroupes. Elle postule que la seule catégorisation en deux groupes distincts entraîne la discrimination à l’encontre de l’exogroupe dans le but de différentier son groupe. L’enjeu de la différentiation est une identité collective positive, celle-ci résultant d’une comparaison intergroupe favorable à l’endogroupe."@autin2010theorie. 
Pour en revenir à  Iyengar, Sood et Lelkes (2012), les auteurs démontrent que les Américains ont développé des sentiments de plus en plus négatifs envers le parti opposé, alors même que leurs propres évaluations de leur parti sont restées relativement stables. Plus significativement, cette augmentation de l'animosité partisane s'est produite sans nécessairement être accompagnée d'une divergence équivalente dans les positions politiques sur les enjeux@lelkes2018affective

LELKES ==> https://ndg.asc.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Forum-Affective-Polarization-and-Ideological-Sorting-A-Reciprocal-Albeit-Weak-Relationship.pdf

Ainsi, les citoyens américains peuvent manifester une hostilité intense envers le parti opposé tout en maintenant des positions politiques relativement modérées et constante. D'après Mason, cité par Steven W. Webster and Alan I. Abramowitz dans The Ideological Foundations of AffectivePolarization in the U.S. Electorate@webster2017ideological : 
“the American
public can hold remarkably moderate and constant issue positions, while
nonetheless becoming progressively more biased, active, and angry when it
comes to politics”@webster2017ideological. De ce point de vue la, cette dissociation entre affect et idéologie suggère que la polarisation contemporaine est davantage une question de "qui nous sommes" (en d'autre terme, qu'est ce que je considère etre, donc a quel communautée je pense appartenir que de "ce en quoi nous croyons" (en d'autre terme quel sont mes modes de pensées, valeur coryance etc...)

== The Role of Social Sorting in Intensifying Affective Polarization
Lilliana Mason developed the concept of "social sorting" to explain how the growing alignment of partisan and ideological identities intensifies affective polarization independently of positions on issues.@mason2015disrespectfully
Social sorting refers to "the process by which an individual's multiple social identities (partisan, ideological, racial, religious) progressively align along a single dimension"@mason2015disrespectfully@mason2016partisan
When an American citizen is simultaneously a Democrat, liberal, urban, non-religious, and a member of an ethnic minority, all these identities mutually reinforce each other and create a "stacked" political identity.
Mason demonstrates empirically that "individuals whose level of partisan-ideological sorting increased over time became much angrier, without necessarily becoming more extreme in their political positions"@mason2015disrespectfully
In her analysis of the ANES 1992-1996 panel, she shows that when an individual goes through a process of aligning their partisan and ideological identities, they emerge angrier than when they entered, but not more extreme on policy issues. This result suggests that "the directional contribution of sorting precedes anger in a way that issue polarization does not"@mason2015disrespectfully

Cette idée pouvant etre un peu dur à comprendre, voici un exemple (comme je l'interperet) : 
- Personne A :
  - Était démocrate mais idéologiquement modéré
  - Devient démocrate ET s'identifie maintenant comme "libéral"
  - Résultat : Plus en colère contre les républicains, MÊME SI ses positions sur les impôts, l'avortement, etc. n'ont pas changé

- Personne B :
  - Était modéré sur les enjeux
  - Devient très à gauche sur l'économie et les droits sociaux
  - Résultat : Moins de colère que la Personne A, même avec des positions plus extrêmes

Le point clé de Mason : L'alignement des identités (sorting) est un moteur de colère plus puissant que l'extrémisme sur les politiques (issue polarization).

The underlying theoretical mechanism rests on research in social psychology showing that individuals with highly aligned identities are generally more intolerant toward out-groups. This is explained by the fact that a person with a well-sorted set of identities is more socially isolated and therefore less experienced in managing measured conflicts, leading to higher levels of anger when faced with threats.@mason2015disrespectfully@mason2016partisan@mason2018uncivil

Törnberg (2022) modeled this process and demonstrated how "digital media amplify partisan sorting by connecting individuals beyond their local bubbles, creating pressure toward global alignment of local political cultures"@tornberg2022partisan
>> https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207159119

== The Ideological Foundations Thesis of Affective Polarization
In direct opposition to the social identity perspective, Webster and Abramowitz (2017) argue that ideological polarization has been a major contributor to affective polarization.@webster2017ideological
"ideological polarization – that is, the secular process by which Democrats and Republicans in the electorate have consistently moved toward the ideological left and right respectively on a set of policy preferences – has been a major contributor to affective polarization"@webster2017ideological 
>> http://www.stevenwwebster.com/affective.pdf

Their analysis shows that the policy preferences of Democratic and Republican elites and voters have considerably diverged on a wide range of issues over recent decades, especially on questions concerning the size and role of government.
When partisans are exposed to information indicating that an opposing party candidate is an "extreme ideologue," their affective evaluations of that candidate decrease significantly. Conversely, when exposed to an opposing party candidate described as a "moderate ideologue," their positive feelings increase.@webster2017ideological

Rogowski and Sutherland (2016) reinforce this perspective by showing that "citizens respond to ideological divergence with increased affective polarization" 
Their experimental study on a nationally representative sample reveals that increasing ideological differences between political figures produces increasingly polarized affective evaluations, and that these differences are particularly pronounced among respondents with stronger ideological commitments and higher levels of political interest
@rogowski2016ideology

== the Reciprocal Relationship: An Integrative Perspective
Faced with these seemingly contradictory positions, several scholars have proposed a more nuanced perspective recognizing a reciprocal relationship between affective polarization and ideological coherence.

Lelkes (2018) used a cross-lagged panel model with ANES 2008-2009 panel data to test the causal direction between these two phenomena. His results reveal that "ideological coherence and affective polarization have a reciprocal relationship@lelkes2018affective
==> Il y a une demonstration MATHEMATIQUE mais j'avoue que je n'ai RIEN COMPRI

Mais conséquences resultat : 
"affective polarization and ideological coherence create a cycle in which the affectively polarized become more ideologically coherent, while the ideologically coherent become more affectively polarized"@lelkes2018affective
However, the relationship is not particularly strong, as indicated by the standardized regression terms. Moreover, lagged ideological coherence only predicts affective polarization among the most politically sophisticated, while lagged affective polarization predicts higher levels of ideological coherence among those with both high and low political knowledge.
"while increased ideological coherence may have led to larger increases in affective polarization among the most politically informed, affective polarization has also increased substantially among the least politically informed" @lelkes2018affective

==  Ideological Identity Versus Issue-Based Ideology
An important contribution to this debate comes from the analytical distinction between ideological identity (attachment to the "liberal" or "conservative" label) and issue-based ideology (actual positions on policies).

Druckman and Levendusky (2019) pose the crucial question: "What do we measure when we measure affective polarization?". They emphasize that affective polarization may have different roots and that policy preferences on issues play an important role in forming partisan feelings, even if social identity processes are also at work.@druckman2019we
- This perspective recognizes that affective polarization is not a monolithic phenomenon and that different dimensions of ideology – identity versus issues – may contribute differently to partisan animosity.

== Issue Alignment and Ideological Constraint
An important development in this debate concerns the evolution of issue alignment (ie : issue that relate to each others, for exampel : If a respondent is against gun control, issue alignment implies one can more accurately guess they also prefer lower inheritance taxes and stricter immigration policy because these stances load on the same ideological dimension.) in the American public.

 Baldassarri and Gelman (2008) documented that Americans were "partisans without constraint" – that is, they were becoming more partisan without their beliefs on a wide range of issues becoming more ideologically structured. Their analysis covering 1972-2004 showed that the relationship between people's attitudes and their partisan affiliation had tightened, but there was little evidence of issue alignment.@baldassarri2008partisans
 >> https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/B&G_PartisansWithoutConstraint_final.pdf
 
However, Kozlowski and Murphy (2021) challenged this conclusion with more recent data covering 1972-2016. They observe that "partisan alignment continued to intensify at an accelerated pace from the 2000s onward, and most notably, there was a significant increase in issue alignment in recent years" @kozlowski2021issue
They find particularly notable increases in correlations between economic and civil rights issues, while moral issues showed more modest increases. This finding challenges academic and public narratives that emphasize morally charged "culture wars" in contemporary politics, suggesting instead that race and class issues are central sources of political division.@kozlowski2021issue

The emergence of issue alignment indicates that Baldassarri and Gelman's representation of the American public as "partisans without constraint" is less accurate today than it was in 2004. These results suggest that the public is not only becoming more partisan, but that its beliefs on a wide range of issues are becoming ideologically structured. These trends challenge Philip Converse's long-standing claim that the public is "innocent of ideology"

== Comparative perspectives : European multiparty systems : 

The extension of research on affective polarization to European multiparty is a good way to nuances the debate about affective polarization  and its link to ideological polarization.

Wagner (2021, 2024) demonstrates that "in European multiparty systems, perceived ideological distance is a strong predictor of affective polarization" (ie ==> . The more citizens perceive a party as ideologically distant from them on the left-right axis, the more likely they are to experience animosity toward supporters of that party) @wagner2021affective @wagner2024affective.
However, Wagner also notes that "the strong correlation between ideological polarization and affective polarization poses a conceptual problem: if the two are highly correlated, what does the study of affective polarization add to what we already know from studying ideological polarization?". This question is particularly relevant in European contexts where affective polarization appears to be more directly linked to policy disagreements than in the United States.@wagner2024affective

Reiljan (2020, 2025) showed that affective polarization exists in European multiparty systems but varies considerably across national contexts. "Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe display the highest scores, followed by North America and Oceania, while Western Europe, Latin America, and Asia present somewhat lower levels"@reiljan2020fear
 This variation suggests that contextual factors – political institutions, party systems, social cleavages – play an important role in shaping affective polarization.

 Comellas  (2023) made an important contribution by examining the role of ideological identity relative to issue-based ideology in five multiparty systems (Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Their results show that "affective attachments to ideological labels increase affective distance between ideological blocs to a greater extent than issue extremism and issue coherence"

>>>PAs eu le temps de tout lire juste résumé rapide mais peut etre tres tres intéressant pour notre démarche franco francaise. 

== Theoretical implications and unresolved questions : 
The debate about the relationship between affective polarization and ideological polarization raises fundamental questions about the nature of contemporary political polarization.

 - Recent research suggests that Affective polarization and ideological polarization appear to mutually influence each other in a reciprocal reinforcement process, although the strength of this relationship varies according to levels of political sophistication and institutional contexts. Moreover, the distinction between ideological identity and issue-based ideology reveals that different dimensions of ideology may contribute differently to affective polarization.
 - Therefore, A crucial unresolved question concerns the predominant causal direction.the relative strength of each direction and the conditions under which one dominates the other remain to be clarified.
 - The differences between bipartisan and multiparty systems in the relationship between affective and ideological polarization suggest that institutional and contextual factors play an important moderating role


== What I think we should do for _la suite_ based on those important works : 
- Adapt Measurement to Multiparty Context (France's recent "tripolarization" (left/center/right) makes this especially relevan)
- Following Mason (2018) and Comellas et al. (2023), separate:
  - Identity ideology: Attachment to labels like "de gauche" / "de droite" / "macroniste"
  - Issue ideology: Actual policy positions on immigration, economy, climate, etc.
- Examine whether French political identities are "stacking" (aligning partisan, ideological, class, urban/rural, ethnic identities)
  - Following this  idea, France may have unique cleavage 
- Consider Institutional Context
- Examine Temporal Dynamics (trends than to be more visible and tell morre important things than just looking at election A or B)

*Wagner (2021) : Affective polarization in multiparty systems*
- Method : 2 ways of measuring AP in multiparty systems (using like-dislike questions)
  1. Spread of like-dislike scores : average of the distance of each party from the average score (≃variance)
  2. Mean distance from the most liked-party : average distance of other parties from the most liked one (limit : considers that an individual likes only one party)
  - Note : important to weight the parties so that the biggest ones weigh more and the smallest ones weigh less
- Findings :
  - The US have average levels of AP among all citizens compared to other countries
    - But more polarized compared to other countries within those individuals with party identification
  - AP tends to be higher in less wealthy / less stable democracies (Kenya, Albania, Montenegro, etc.)

  *Wagner (2024) : Affective polarization in Europe*
  - Method : state-of-the-art review
  - Findings :
    - AP in the US isn't unusually high compared to other countries
    - Lack of an overall trend towards AP (increasing in the US but decreasing in other places)
    - Stronger link between IP and AP is stronger in countries that are 1) ideologically polarized, 2) older democracies, 3) parliamentary systems and 4) smaller party systems (Riera & Madariaga, 2023)
    - Negative partisanship in Europe is often against the radical right
    - Coalitions between parties can reduce hostility between their supporters
    - Parliamentary presence of women in a party reduces hostility towards it
    - In many countries patterns of AP fall into larger groups, so even though there are more parties, there's few distinct camps (e.g. "the left" encompassing several parties that do not consider themselves adversaries)
    - Partisan labels create in-group biases at least as strong as ethnic group favoritism
    - The radical right is disliked more than the radical left (even higher than what their ideological distance and lack of government representation would predict)
    - AP is correlated to democratic backsliding, low social and institutional trust, and the tendency to support norm-breaking escalation of political conflict
    - AP may have some positive consequences (not sure yet) : political engagement and exclusion of anti-democratic actors

*Torcal & Harteveld (2025) : Handbook of Affective Polarization*
- Europe (Reiljan) :
  - AP is higher in Eastern Europe (shorter democratic experience) than in Northern and Western Europe (well-consolidated democracies)
  - Positive correlation between government corruption and AP
  - Positive correlation between salient ethnic divisions and AP
  - Negative correlation between the political elite's consensual policy-making culture and AP
  - Negative correlation between a higher share of women MPs and AP
  - Different party structures :
    - NWE : 2 large affective blocs (center-left vs center-right) + right populist challenger hostile with both
    - SE : weaker affective alignment
    - CEE : little affective alignment (more chaotic)
  - Individuals extend their (dis)like of parties to supporters of these parties
- Latin America (Moraes & Béjar) :
  - Parties and party systems tend to be less institutionalized in Latin America
    - Partisan AP vs leader AP
  - LAP (= personalism) : mais source of AP in Latam
- East Asia (Hsiao & Yu) :
  - AP structured by specific issues in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (potential external threats coming from China and North Korea)




= Paragraph 3 - Tripolarisation et systèmes partisans français 
In order to study affective polarisation in France, it will be necessary to have a look at the French political and party system. This is especially important as it is not a fixed construct, and as it is one that possesses multiple specific characteristics. 

Before anything else, however, we must ask ourselves what a party system is. Persico and Haegel @haegel2017chapitre define it as "the sum of the interactions between parties in a given political system, [that] implies the coexistence of multiple parties, which find themselves engaged in relationships of a rival and cooperative nature, mainly in the electoral arena". This offers a rather comprehensive definition, which allows for a comparative perspective.
A COMPLETER IDEALEMENT


== The French Party System before 2022
The French party system has been the topic of rather significant academic attention, at least since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958. However, in order to be thorough, we must split this paragraph in two: first, we will focus on pre-2015 work, focusing on the bipartisan nature of the system, and we will then go over post-2015 literature, chiefly spearheaded by Florent Gougou, which covers the collapse of French bipartism and its recomposition into a new "tripartisan" landscape. 

A comprehensive overview of late-20th century French party politics can be traced to Perraudeau @perraudeau2001systeme. Following a period of multipartism under the Fourth Republic, the birth of the Fifth and multiple concurrent factors, such as the birth of the Gaullist _UNR_ and the introduction of direct Presidential elections (a method unseen since 1848) would lead to a process of bipolarisation between the Gaullist majority and the non-Gaullist opposition. Such a process would last until 1974, which would see a further specialisation of the system into what Maurice Duverger would call a _quadrille bipolaire_: a bipartisan system with two "big" parties on each side : the PCF and PS on the left, and the UDF and RPR on the right. However, Perraudeau ends by commenting on the now-fragmented state of French politics due to a succession of changes of the party in power, unlike from 1958 to 1981, and also due to recompositions inside the left and the right themselves. 

Evans @evans2003french, in her introduction to _The French Party System_ laid out the iconoclastic character of the system. In the book, special attention is paid to the heterogeneous character of the French "left" and "right", with both encompassing multiple formations, many of which are not allied and sometimes outright opposed to each other: a good example of that is the multiplication of left-wing candidates in the 2002 presidential elections, in which four of them were from parties belonging to the incumbent government. Evans pays special attention to the Front National's attempts to present itself as "against both blocs" despite it being traditionally labeled as far-right, while observing its infortune at achieving major electoral gains due to the bipartisan and "two-block" nature of the system; still, she remarks that the "right-extremist" camp has managed to consistently grow in voter share, despite it not translating into substantial gains of seats in the legislature. Evans' takeaway, then, might be that conjectural changes have led to distortions with the traditional _quadrille_, but that those have largely taken place within a relatively stable bipartisan framework. 

Commenting on the 2007 presidential election, Grunberg @grunberg2007france seem to point towards the establishment of an UMP-PS bipartisan system, most notably thanks those parties more successfully adapting themselves to the institutional logic of the Presidential election, allowing them to gain more leverage over other parties on their side of the political landscape due to a higher vote share in those elections. This, again, would seem to confirm the "fluid-bipartisan" nature of the French political system: a small number of big, "government" parties, flanked by coalition partners who have more or less successfully carved out a niche in terms of voter base, and by extremist formations which contest the government parties from the fringes of the system. 

== The French Party System after 2022
That period of bipartism, however, seems to have come and gone. The presidential elections of 2017, have been interpreted as one of the first key markers of the recomposition of the French party system. Rafidinarivo @rafidinarivo2017dynamique studies the overseas departments, and considers the election to be a "realignment election", that is one in which the political and party system sees major and radical changes which stick in time and endures for multiple electoral occurrences afterwards. Basing herself on the surge in voter share for Marine Le Pen, the candidate of the far-right National Front, in the overseas departments, the author posits that one of the traditional bipartisan poles has been replaced overseas by Le Pen's camp, and that more generally the UMP-PS bipartism has seemingly been replaced, at least overseas, by a competition between EM! and the FN: this means the end of the _bipartisme d'alternance_. 

The French party system has seemingly moved away from a bipartisan one. But what has it become? Florent Gougou @gougou2022consolidation posits that the 2022 elections have shown that the 2017 election truly was a realignment one, with the 2022 being a "consolidation election", consolidating and cementing for the foreseeable future the new electoral order which had been creeping onto the forefront between 2017 et 2022. The French political system, Gougou says, has shifted from a bipartisan one to a "tripolar" one, in which three political and partisan poles square off against each other: a social-ecological one (represented by the NUPES and NFP coalitions),a liberal-globalist one (represented by the Ensemble coalition), and a identitarian and authoritarian conservative one (RN and allies, and R!).

Gougou, along with Guerra and Persico, have pursued such an analysis @gougou2024tripartition, in order to elaborate on the concept of "tripolarisation" and on the makeup of the three "poles": they find that each pole has a specific trend on various axes (such as, for example, authoritarianism against libertarianism or economic interventionism against laissez-faire liberalism), and that each also sees a differently-composed voter base in terms of socio-economic characteristics. Their main takeaway is that there is a key difference with previous French party systems under the Fifth Republic: while there previously could be considered to be a tripolarisation in terms of values (Left-Right-RN), the logic in terms of access to power stayed strictly bipartisan, whereas today both value system and access to power subscribe to a bipartisan logic.  

The "surprise" 2024 legislative elections would come to confirm the realignment into a tripolar party system @gougou2025france. The relative scarcity of majority governments since 2022 confirms that the tripolar makeup of the National Assembly and of the political landscape signals a clean break with the past, and shows that the French party system has become a truly tripolar one rather than a bipolar one as it used to be.


= Paragraph 4 - What do we know can influence affective polarisation and ideological polarisation
	In this last part, we need to address some peripheral matters, especially others elements than the political landscape that can have an influence on affective and ideological polarisation. Indeed, if we take a broader picture, we might be able to draw some links between external elements, meaning non strictly political causes. In this case, through our researches, as a group, we focused on the media’s effect regarding affective polarisation. By media, we clearly mentioned the mainstream and social one. Thus, by looking at Petter Törnberg Claes and his co-author Claes Andersson, Kristian Lindgren and Sven Banisch we are able to tackle some part of what they call the “emergence of affective polarization in the social media society” (@tornberg2021modeling). However, on a more sociological leaning, some works and authors such as Lilliana Mason showed the role of identities in the level of affective polarisation.
