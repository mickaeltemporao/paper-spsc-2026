  title: "Measuring Affective Polarization in France",

    #set par(justify: true) 

This study investigates affective polarization (AP) in France, focusing on emotional hostility between political groups operates within a tripolar multiparty system. Whereas most AP research centers on the United States or broad cross-national comparisons, France's recent shift from an imperfect bipartisan system to a three-bloc configuration offers a unique  opportunity to reassess how AP emerges when partisan identities are weak but political emotions run high. 

This matters because AP shape trust, cooperation, and democratic stability. Understanding how AP functions in a fragmented system like France helps clarify whether extreme parties, party age, and centrist moderation amplify or mitigate emotional devides - an issue increasingly relevant across all European democracies. 

Previous studies have examined AP through social-identity and ideological frameworks, explored its presence in multiparty systems, and analyzed cases such as Spain, Norway or Brazil. However, France remains understudied despite strong evidence of rising affect declining partisan attachment. 

This project improves on existing work by focusing specifically on France's tripolar structure, considering not only how centrists perceive out-groups but also how other blocs perceive centrists. It also introduces the role of party age - whether older, historically rooted parties generate stronger affective reactions than newer actors. 

We expect to find that centrist exhibit lower AP, that supporters of ideologically extreme parties (LFI, RN) show higher levels of emotional polarization, and that older parties are more frequent targets of affective hostility. These findings will offer a more nuanced understanding of AP in contemporary multiparty democracies.

== Introduction

=== State of art 

The literature on affective polarization reveals two main perspectives on the concept. The first, rooted in social identity theory, views AP as a product of group belonging and emotional rejection of the “other,” even in the absence of strong ideological disagreement @iyengar2012affect@dias2022nature. According to this view, partisan attachment operates primarily as a social identity, shaping how individuals perceive and evaluate opposing groups. The second approach, by contrast, is ideological in nature: it emphasizes the role of political cleavages and ideological distance in fueling emotional polarization @rogowski2016ideology@tiberj2024droitisation. While both perspectives agree on the central role of emotions in political behavior, they diverge on the primary source of these affects—social identity versus ideological conflict. In multiparty systems, this distinction becomes even more complex, as antagonisms are not strictly binary but rather diffuse across several competing parties or blocs @wagner2021affective@garzia2023affective.

Comparative research has demonstrated that affective polarization is not confined to two-party systems. Studies conducted in countries such as Norway and Spain show that AP also operates within multiparty contexts, where it tends to structure itself around clusters or blocs of parties rather than dyadic oppositions @knudsen2021affective@torcal2022affective. The moderating role of centrist parties remains contested: while some scholars argue that the presence of a strong center mitigates affective divisions by promoting compromise @bettarelli2023regional, others maintain that it can blur ideological boundaries and foster new forms of fragmentation @garzia2023affective.

Recent work has further expanded the analytical lens by examining how communication dynamics and media ecosystems contribute to AP. Studies on digital media and negative identities show that polarization may arise even in the absence of strong partisan identification, as affective cues circulate through online networks and emotional narratives @areal2022affective@lee2022social@viscarra2024arrefecimento. This supports the idea that affective polarization is as much a communicative and emotional phenomenon as it is a structural one.

Overall, scholars converge on the view that affective polarization extends beyond the American two-party context and is shaped by an interplay of social, institutional, and communicative factors @wagner2021affective@reiljan2025affective. Yet, significant divergences persist regarding the mechanisms that drive or mitigate it. One key debate concerns the role of the political center: some see it as a stabilizing force capable of bridging divides @knudsen2021affective, while others argue that it further fragments the political landscape @garzia2023affective. Another unresolved question concerns the impact of party novelty—whether older, well-established parties elicit stronger affective reactions @rogowski2016ideology, or whether newer populist movements intensify emotional divides through moralized rhetoric @areal2022affective@tiberj2024droitisation. Methodological discussions also remain open, as standardized comparative indicators often obscure national specificities and the multi-directional nature of affective polarization.

=== The French Context and the Main Hypothesis
Affective Polarization (AP) has been a widely studied concept to explain the divisions that mark the political landscape of the United States for the last ten years @iyengar2012affect @rogowski2016ideology @muzychuk2024causes @lee2022social. The concept was also applied to multiparty systems in European countries as agglomerates, where scholars emphasized different ways of measurement and importance in different countries @wagner2021affective @wagner2024affective @garzia2023affective @bettarelli2023regional . However, these studies tend to include cultural and political particularities that are taken account of when measuring the concept in the US only to a small extend since their aspiration is mostly comparative (see e.g. @reiljan2025affective). There are studies investigating the AP of single European political landscapes with similar depth as the studies on the US, e.g. on Spain  @torcal2022affective @torcal2023social or on Norway @knudsen2021affective. 

In terms of multi-party systems, one can also point to Brazil as a country in which affective polarization was studied. For example, Areal takes a look at AP through the use of negative identities and negative identification, meaning the identification of oneself _against_ an opposing party or political leader @areal2022affective. On a more precise scale, Viscarra explores the impact of affective polarization through an analysis of governors and gubernatorial candidates' online rhetoric during the 2022 election @viscarra2024arrefecimento. The Brazilian political system, which can be described as "coalitional presidential system" @zucco2024ideology, combining important political power and a multi-party system thus serves as an interesting case study of the various ways AP can manifest itself. 

Still, most countries lack this in-depth analysis. France is a particular interesting case, not only because of its semi-presidential system, but also because of recent historical developments in its political culture. For the last ten years, and especially since the 2022 presidential election, there has been an ongoing debate on whether the old bipartition transformed into a tripartite system @gougou2024tripartition, @rafidinarivo2017dynamique. Indeed: a system that was previously under a form of imperfect bipartisanism @grunberg2007france has seemingly shifted towards a tripartite or "tri-bloc" system, in which three political and partisan poles square off against each other: a social-ecological one (represented by the NUPES and NFP coalitions),a liberal-globalist one (represented by the Ensemble coalition), and a identitarian and authoritarian conservative one (RN and allies, and R!). This development, most noticeable starting with the 2022 presidential election, has seemingly been confirmed with the 2024 legislative elections @gougou2025france. 

Also, a strong affect but low attachment to any party has been observed @tiberj2024droitisation,a pattern that echoes previous findings @dias2022nature, who show that high affective polarization can emerge even when partisan identification is weak, as affect often stems from social and ideological cues rather than stable party ties. Studying AP in France might give insights on how AP works in general, how it can relate to different other concepts like partisanship, age and different degrees of radicalism.

=== How can electoral systems and multiparty competition influence AP?


A “winner-takes-all” electoral system often makes political competition more emotional and divisive. Because only one party can win and take full control of power, political debates tend to become framed as a struggle between two opposing sides. In such systems, voters may begin to see politics less as a process of collective problem-solving and more as a battle between “us” and “them.” This can increase affective polarization, meaning that citizens not only disagree on issues but also develop strong negative feelings toward members of the opposing camp. The emotional distance between partisans grows, reducing trust and making cooperation more difficult.

In contrast, in a multiparty system where a centrist party holds a meaningful position, the dynamics of political competition can change significantly. A centrist party often acts as a bridge between opposing ideological blocs. The presence of a centrist party can reshape how citizens perceive political identity. Instead of dividing into two hostile camps, voters may come to see politics as a space of negotiation and compromise. Even individuals with strong partisan preferences might recognize shared interests or common values when centrist actors are involved in policymaking. Over time, this can promote a more cooperative political culture and weaken the emotional boundaries that separate partisans. In this sense, the centrist idea does not only occupy a middle position in ideological terms; it also represents a less affective polarized party that has an impact in the overall polarization.

Then, older parties tend to create more affective polarization than new parties, due to their better implantation in the political life and the political fights they led before. The far-right parties also seem to affective polarize more than the other averages parties.

Overall, France combines a relatively non-proportional electoral system with a low propensity for political coalitions, making it more susceptible to emotional polarization.

== Hypothesis 

Our hypothesis are being guided by the connections we have observed within our sources. In order to better understand and visualize this, we have organized our main ideas in a chart @brainstorm. With the this in mind we can spell out our main hypothesis and it's secondary explanations.

*Main hypothesis:* In the french multiparty system, individuals with centrist political orientations exhibit lower levels of affective polarization compared to individuals with more ideologically extreme position (left or right).

- $H_1$:  The presence of multiple viable parties in France dilutes binary political identities, reducing overall affective polarization, particularly among centrists.\
- $H_2$: Supporters of extreme parties (e.g., La France Insoumise or Rassemblement National) display higher AP compared to those supporting centrist parties (e.g., Renaissance or MoDem).\
- $H_3$: (Supporters of) Old parties are more the object of AP than (supporters of) parties that gained importance recently (definition of this - is RN old or new? is LFI old or new? Macron?)

== Data & Methods

The fact that only wide European landscapes have been studied is also a consequence of the data analyzed - databases like the ESS, EES or CSES are easily available and incite the comparison of countries more than a deep dive into single countries specificities.

- Use the official parties classification (settled before elections) to place French parties on a political scale from 0 to 10.
- For the centrist AP : not only measure the relations of Centrists toward out-groups but also the relations of other political blocs toward centrists --> Help to understand the tripolization.

=== Questions from the ESS survey
In the ESS round 11 from 2023 there are no questions directly related to how much the respondent like or dislike the others parties. This might therefore not be the best dataset for this research. The questions stayed approximately the sames the years before regarding this issue. However we could still be interested by some of those questions : 

- B9 : On a score of 0-10 how much you personally trust political parties. 0 means you do not trust an institution at all, and 10 means you have complete trust

- B15 to B22, in order to know if the respondent is a militant, and if so, does it make him more or less affectively polarized : 
 - There are different ways of trying to improve things in [country] or help prevent things from going wrong.
 - During the last 12 months, have you done any of the following?
  - Have you…contacted a politician, government or local government official?
  - ...donated to or participated in a political party or pressure group ?
  - ...worn or displayed a campaign badge/sticker? 
  - …signed a petition? 
  - …taken part in a public demonstration? 
  - …boycotted certain products? 
  - …posted or shared anything about politics online, for example on blogs, via email or on social media such as Facebook or Twitter11?
  - …volunteered for a not-for-profit or charitable organization?

- B23 : Is there a particular political party you feel closer to than all the other parties? 

- B24 : Which one?

- B25 How close do you feel to this party? Do you feel that
 - you are… very close, 1
 - quite close, 2
 - not close, 3
 - or, not at all close? 4
 - (Refusal) 7
 - (Don’t know) 

- B26 : In politics people sometimes talk of “left” and “right”. Using this card, where would you place yourself on this scale, where 0 means the left and 10 means the right? Left Right (Refusal) (Don’t know)
